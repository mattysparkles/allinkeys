You are analyzing a Python codebase for a Bitcoin key generation pipeline that includes GPU acceleration via pyopencl and a VanitySearch integration. The altcoin_derive.py script converts output from VanitySearch .txt files into multi-coin .csv files. 

PROBLEM:
We're encountering an error repeatedly during GPU derivation blocks:
  'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x8f in position 1476: character maps to <undefined>

NOTES:
- This happens during `convert_txt_to_csv()` in altcoin_derive.py.
- It continues even after decoding input files in binary mode, with a custom `safe_lines()` generator.
- We suspect the issue is not the input file itself but either:
    - Unicode errors from an `Exception` object being stringified and logged.
    - Logging or printing of non-ASCII bytes via log_message() or traceback.print_exc()
    - Or possibly subprocess/spawn incompatibility with GPU or multiprocessing threads.

Also, once the loop starts, we cannot break it using Ctrl+C (KeyboardInterrupt is swallowed or ignored), which may mean a bad threading or subprocess control structure.

TASK:
1. Trace every place where string conversion or exception logging happens.
2. Identify any subprocesses, threads, or logging calls that could be holding the main thread hostage.
3. Ensure we are not using daemon threads in GPU or conversion loops, which would block Ctrl+C.
4. Recommend precise places to patch and wrap exception-to-string conversions with `.encode('ascii', errors='replace')` to prevent `charmap` errors.
5. Trace whether any subprocess outputs or stdout redirections are injecting binary or malformed content.

OUTPUT:
- A prioritized fix plan
- Optional: Refactored function that resolves the problem and restores KeyboardInterrupt control.
